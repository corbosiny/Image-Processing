# Image-Processing
Work on learning image processing, to make a fully functional zombie tracking sentry gun for HvZ

The folders uploaded as follows:
    backgroundMovementReduction
    cornerDetecting
    detectColor
    edge_Detection
    faceEyeDetecting
    templateMatching
    Thresholding
These folders all use Python 2 with a pip installation of cv2 and numpy. You will need either a piCamera, or a webcam. 
These programs give us the tools to work with image recognition, all the tools lead to fine tuning of the faceEyeDetection, which uses xml files that follow a haarcascade respository created by Intel.
